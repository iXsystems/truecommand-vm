-----------------------------
First-time setup recommendation:
1. Check that networking is up and running: `ip address`
   * Edit the "/etc/network/interfaces" file to set a static IP as needed: `sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces`
2. Ensure that the truecommand instance is running: `sudo docker ps`
-----------------------------
Quick Reference Guide
* Switch to root access: `sudo su`
* TrueCommand service interaction: `systemctl [status|start|stop] truecommand.service`
* Check current VM IP: `ip addr`
